      <description>Recently in class, we have been using Python to explore essential packages and functions that assist in the ease of data manipulation. My personal favorite has been Reguar Expression operations. RegEx helps to learn how to match, search, and transform a string. Let&#39;s look at a few examples!
Wait wait wait. We&#39;ve already encountered our first problem. How can I show you Python coding if I&#39;m using R to build this website?</description>

      <description>Although I&#39;ve struggled quite a bit with program language used for coding due to its complexity, I find comfort in knowing I have the ability to fact-check data or even create my own datasets for research.
Recently in class, we have been using Python to explore essential packages such as numpy and pandas. Numpy is a Python library helpful for working with arrays. In particular, we worked</description>

      <description>Madelyn Oliveri mmo698, Project 1 *In this study I will be comparing motor vehicle data alongside U.S civilian house fire data; in-particular, examining trends in the number of deaths over the years from each type of accident, with the common variable being the year (1960-2018). Motor vehicle accident data was collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics which includes motorcycles while excluding commercial vehicles. It includes the number of crashes, the total number of deaths (presented as Deaths.</description>

      <description>This dataset of 75 observations contains information to study any potential correlations or predictors of relationships between salary, educational background degree type, etc. There are many factors that influence salaries and degrees obtained such as experience, opportunity, family operations, business owner status, future goals, etc., but comparisons between this smaller set of variables may provide some type of trend and clarity on the relationships. The variables are as follows:</description>
