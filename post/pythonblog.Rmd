Insert Introduction

Recently in class, we have been using Python to explore essential packages such as NumPy and Pandas. Numpy is a Python library tailored more for numeric data -specifically the manipuation of arrays - and Pandas is a Python library helpful with tabular data; like columns or rows of numbers. Additionally, we've utilized Reguar Expression operations in helping to learn how to match, search, and transform a string. 

What has become even *more* interesting and useful in class is the combination of Python and R with 'reticulate'. It's like combining two normal-sized brains that haveh two different thoughts, two different talents, and two different processes into one MEGAMIND. (insert evil laugh here)

Let's use all of the above in some simple examples!
