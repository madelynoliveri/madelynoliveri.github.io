Recently in class, we have been using Python to explore essential packages such as NumPy and Pandas. Numpy is a Python library tailored more for numeric data -specifically the manipuation of arrays - and Pandas is a Python library helpful with tabular data; like columns or rows of numbers. 



Additionally, we've utilized Reguar Expression operations in helping to learn how to match, search, and transform a string. Let's look at a few examples!


Wait wait wait. We've already encountered our first problem. How can I show you Python coding if I'm using R? I know you were panicking, but have no fear! Technology is here!


R and Python can talk to each other with **reticulate**! Think of it as combining two brains. The brains have two different ways of thinking, two different ways of processing their thoughts, and two different special talents that make them unique. When you combine these two brains, you get a... MEGAMIND. (*insert evil laugh here*) 


Now! let's backtrack a little bit by starting with reticulate and *then* getting into some examples of Numpy, Pandas, and a few Regular Expression operations. 


**1. RETICULATE**
```{R}
library(reticulate) 

```


**3. Regular Expression Operations**

Here is a string I have created. It's a bunch of nonsense. Much like the 'Ctrl f' function on your keyboard when you're quickly searching for keywords, regular expressions can help us skip the said nonsense and find what we're looking for. 

In this case, lets extract any numbers.
```{python}
import re

string1="Is it weird the numbers that we remember in life that take up our brain space and yet are no longer needed? My lunch number in elementary school was 129780. Cool. What am I gonna do with that now? Or the sticker on the banana that shows the produce code at grocery stores is usually #4011. Again, I don't know why I ever noticed that or how it got stuck in my head. I don't even eat bananas."

extract = re.findall(r'\d+', string1) 
print(extract)
```

So what just happened? Simply, d = numeric values [0-9] and the plus sign indicates
